		<p>now go back to <a href = "./Learntextlinks.html#hthree">target attribute heading</a>. this is a two step process. first set the name of tag which you want to link in this anchor text. then use that name in this anchor tag. using name attribute is depreated in html5. use id or title instead.</p>

		<h3>changing colors of links, active links and visited links</h3>
		<p>changed the link aink vlink attributes value in body tag <a href = "https://www.google.com.pk/">google</a></p>		
		
		<h3>downloadlinks</h3>
		<p>test <a href = "./images/img1.jpg">download</a>. if you want that user is displayed a download dialog box instead of the actual content. then you may want to use perlcgi</p>
